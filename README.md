# Take-Home Assignment

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This repo houses all the materials for my take-home assignment, which is a coding challenge for a Software Engineering position. Let me walk you through what's in here.

## What's in this Repository

### The Challenge Materials

We've broken down the submission into three files (as requested) that you'll want to check out:

- **[deliverable-01.md](./deliverable-01.md)** - This is where it all starts! Main coding challenge
- **[deliverable-02.md](./deliverable-02.md)** - Thought process behind the coding challenge, and evaluation criteria
- **[deliverable-03.md](./deliverable-03.md)** - A rather subjective approach to an ideal solution

### What the Candidate Gets

When we share this challenge with candidates, they'll get everything in the **[sample-github-repo/](./sample-github-repo/)** folder. We've set it up with:

- A starter README that walks them through the challenge
- The healthcare claims dataset (CSV format) + data key they'll need to work with

That's it! Pretty straightforward setup that should get everyone up and running quickly.
